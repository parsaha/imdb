# IMDb EDA
## About
The purpose of this repo is just to house Jupyter notebooks that detail my journey scraping, exploring, cleaning, and presenting IMDb data to find the average rating over all their works that IMDb has listed for any given actor. 

There is a folder `imdb-EDA`, showing my process of finding and understanding the data. There is also a folder `general-imdb` which has my notebook where I create the code that actually allows for accessing the average and visalizations. 

## Motivation
A general curiosity is to blame. One day I set out to find the average score for movies with Zach Galifinakais in them; a week later, the first draft of this repo is being pushed to Github. 

## Further Work
In the future, the goal is to add a nicer, more interactive front end.
